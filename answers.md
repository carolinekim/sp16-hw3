1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?
    New instantiates a new Model instance, but is not saved until the save method is called. In comparison to new, create (does the same as new) but saves it to the database right away.

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?
    New + save will emulate the same behavior as create.

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
    The "timestamps" column exists on every table, even with us not specifically defining it.

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "hat" in the database?
    Cat.create name:"hat"

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?
    It has been tough to do everything on my own after only viewing the lectures (I hope we can get some practice during class in lab format). For this homework, however, it was super helpful to have links to pages that contain information on what we need to do.

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?
    As mentioned above, it was a lot easier to understand with the given links and I actually feel like I learned a lot through working out the problems in this homework.
